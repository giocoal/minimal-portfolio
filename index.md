<div style="text-align: justify">Has **air quality** improved over the past 15 years in and around Milan? Is the concentration of pollutants higher in winter or summer? and why? What are the main pollutants, and what meteorological and anthropogenic factors influence the seasonal pattern of their concentrations?
<br>
We tried to answer these, and other, questions by analyzing data from ARPA Lombardy. The results of our analysis were then displayed in an **interactive infographic** created using the **Tableau** platform.

<div style="text-align: justify">
PROMs are patient-reported outcome measures following an operation or health treatment, often used to assess the quality of health care.
<br>
We evaluated the possible presence of a relationship between the outcomes of mental and physical health status assessments of a sample of patients, following surgery, and the weather conditions relative to the time of questionnaire completion.

<div style="text-align: justify">
One of the most critical processes in finance is the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions. It is possible to detect these frauds with different machine learning algorithms, but what is the most effective classifier to accomplish this task?
<br>
In the first part of the project, we compared different techniques to counter the presence of unbalanced classes within the dataset. Then we compared the performance of some of the most widely used classification algorithms in this area. To determine the best method, we did not limit ourselves to the usual metrics but also took into account the costs to the financial institution related to any errors the model may make, a key aspect in this area.

Data analysis of the results of computational simulations of the water adsorption process on atmospheric particulate matter models.
<br>
My work involved the development of a script in Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), capable of performing an automated (frame-by-frame) data analysis of the configurations (atomic coordinates of water molecules) generated during each simulation, conducted at a specific H2O pressure value.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The idea behind the project is to create a database containing information related to the competitive Pokémon videogame, with particular reference to the Video Game Championship Series 12 rules, the official format in effect for official tournaments and events during the period February - August 2022 and valid for the Pokémon World Championship in London in August 2022. The goal is to obtain a useful tool as a support for competitive play, both for novice and experienced players. The different Pokémon are placed in relation to the teammates, moves, tools, skills the basic statistics with which they are most frequently matched within teams in competitive matches. For this reason, the choice on the type of database to be implemented fell on a graph database, implemented through Neo4J. The choice of the graph database allowed us to take advantage of its characteristic of being schema less, which allows us to create nodes, to model the different entities, and arcs, to model the various relationships, without following a predefined schema. The database was populated through data obtained through API and Web Scraping, appropriately integrated and processed.
