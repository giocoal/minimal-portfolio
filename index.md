<div style="text-align: justify">Has air quality improved over the past 15 years in and around Milan? Is the concentration of pollutants higher in winter or summer? and why? What are the main pollutants, and what meteorological and anthropogenic factors influence the seasonal pattern of their concentrations?
<br>
We tried to answer these, and other, questions by analyzing data from ARPA Lombardy. The results of our analysis were then displayed in an interactive infographic created using the Tableau platform.</div>
