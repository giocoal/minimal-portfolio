<b>Brain</b> T1-Weighted <b>MRI</b> Images <b>Classification</b> and <b>WGAN Generation</b> (<b>Alzheimer's</b> and Healthy patients) for the purpose of data augmentation. Implemented in TensorFlow, trained on ADNI dataset.
<br> <br>
This project focused on Alzheimer's Disease through three main objectives. Firstly, a dataset of axial 2D slices was created from 3D T1-weighted MRI brain images, integrating clinical, genetic, and biological sample data. Secondly, a <b>Custom Resnet-18</b> was trained to classify these images, distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's. Lastly, different techniques for managing class imbalance were evaluated to improve the classifier's performance and reduce bias, including the training of a generative model (<b>Wasserstein GAN</b>) on Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy images for the purpose of generative data augmentation.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The project consists in the application of <b>different classification models</b> to a dataset containing data relating to credit card transactions for the <b>detection of financial fraud</b>.
<br> <br>
One of the most critical processes in finance is the <b>detection of fraudulent credit card transactions</b>. It is possible to detect these frauds with different machine learning algorithms, but what is the most effective <b>classifier</b> to accomplish this task?
<br>
In the first part of the project, we compared different techniques to counter the presence of unbalanced classes within the dataset. Then we compared the performance of some of the most widely used classification algorithms in this area. To determine the best method, we did not limit ourselves to the usual metrics but also took into account the costs to the financial institution related to any errors the model may make, a key aspect in this area.

<div style="text-align: justify">
During a <b>research internship</b> at the <b>Computational Physical Chemistry Laboratory</b> at the <b>University of Milano-Bicocca</b> i took part in a research project concerning the study, by means of <b>Monte Carlo computational simulations</b> in the Grand Canonical ensemble, of the <b>adsorption</b> process of <b>water</b> on model <b>surfaces of sodium chloride</b> (NaCl) atmospheric particulate matter of marine origin. <br>
My work involved performing a data analysis, and in particular a <b>cluster analysis</b> and <b>orientational analysis</b>, on the results of the 3-D molecular mechanics simulations, leveraging <b>unsupervised machine learning</b> (<b>DBSCAN</b>) for water <b>clusters detection</b>. <br>
I developed a script in Python language (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), capable of performing an automated (frame-by-frame) <b>data analysis of the configurations</b> (atomic coordinates of water molecules) generated during each simulation, conducted at a specific H2O pressure value. <br>
The results of the analysis provided a <b>molecular-level understanding</b> of the <b>aggregative phenomena</b> that characterise the adsorption process of water vapor on the NaCl surface. In particular, the script allows to: identify the number of clusters present in the system, classify them into 'islands' or 'layers' according to their shape and size, and study the orientation of water molecules moving away from the NaCl surface. <br>
The results of my study are collected in my <b>Bachelor's thesis</b>: <a href="https://github.com/giocoal/cluster-analysis-on-computational-chemistry-simulations-water-adsorption-on-atmosperic-particulate/blob/main/thesis%20manuscript%20and%20presentation%20slides/Thesis.pdf">"Cluster Analysis on the Results of Molecular Simulation of the Water Adsorption Process on Atmospheric Particulate Models."</a> <br>
Furthermore, during the course of the year 2023, I subsequently contributed, in the context of a voluntary collaboration with the corresponding authors' research groups, to the development of a <b>paper</b> entitled: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6740/11/11/421">"Theoretical Investigation of Inorganic Particulate Matter: The Case of Water Adsorption on a NaCl Particle Model Studied Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations."</a> (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yJfbN8AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra">F.

The <b>forecasting</b> of <b>time series</b> of <b>electricity consumption</b> plays an important role in efficient resource management and strategic planning in the energy sector. In this project, we analyse a <b>univariate, homogeneous, high-frequency time series</b> of electricity consumption measured every 10 minutes from 01/01/2017 to 30/11/2017, comparing <b>statistical (ARIMA and UCM)</b>, <b>Machine Learning (Random Forest and k-NN)</b> and <b>Deep Learning (GRU Recurrent Neural Network)</b> approaches to model the time series and forecast consumption for the month of December 2017. The best performing of the models in each family, trained on data sampled between 01/01/2017 to 31/10/2017 (or a portion thereof) and validated on November 2017 data, resulted in the following error measures: MAE(ARIMA)=1010.08, MAE(UCM)=1183.40 and MAE(ML)= 1184.07, leading the ARIMA approach to be the most accurate in forecasting among those tested.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Data Acquisition and Modeling: <b>Graph database</b> containing information related to <b>competitive Pok√©mon videogames</b>, <b>scraped</b> from various sources
<br> <br>
The idea behind the project is to create a <b>graph database</b> containing information related to the <b>competitive Pok√©mon videogame</b>, with particular reference to the Video Game Championship Series 12 rules, the official format in effect for official tournaments and events during the period February - August 2022 and valid for the Pok√©mon World Championship in London in August 2022. The goal is to obtain a useful <b>tool as a support for competitive play</b>, both for novice and experienced players. The different <b>Pok√©mon are placed in relation to the teammates, moves, tools and the basic statistics with which they are most frequently matched</b> within teams in competitive matches. For this reason, the choice on the type of database to be implemented fell on a graph database, implemented through <b>Neo4J</b>. The choice of the graph database allowed us to take advantage of its characteristic of being schema less, which allows us to create nodes, to model the different entities, and arcs, to model the various relationships, without following a predefined schema. The database was populated through data obtained through <b>API</b> and <b>Web Scraping</b>, appropriately integrated and processed.
